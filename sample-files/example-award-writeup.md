 
## Exceptional Performance Award Example
Space & Intel Division, Kobayashi Maru DevOps Contract Period: 01 Jul 2022 - 30 September 2023 Members: Samuel Marrs, DevOps/Software Engineer 

## Amount Requested  
$10,000.00 

## Reason 
Sustained Superior Performance 

## Justification 
During this period Sam consistently exceeded Government objectives and delivery of products and services resulting in sustained superior performance. 

## Eager to solve big problems 
The Government challenged SPA to assist in the delivery of SSC’s number one mission priority – the delivery of ATLAS as part of the decommissioning of SPADOC. Kobayashi Maru’s Platform and Infrastructure Portfolio was improperly resourced to successfully deliver ATLAS. Samuel Marrs, Software Engineer developing software products/apps within Kobayashi Maru, jumped at the opportunity to stand up a new team to solve this complex problem. 

## Exceptional Technical Abilities 
He took on the responsibility of devising a high availability and resilient solution/approach to hosting, installing, upgrading, patching, and maintaining all of Kobayashi Maru’s internal tooling required for software development and deployment on Kubernetes. This required Sam to step beyond his comfort zone and stressed his technical abilities. He had to embrace DevOps engineering techniques traditionally outside of the area of responsibility of software engineers. He committed countless hours of his personal time to refine his skills and taught himself how to implement DevOps best practices for Kobayashi Maru. He even took it a step further by blending these Bet Practices with the concepts of Extreme Programming and Test-Driven Development. This approach substantially reduced errors in performance and deployment, enabled automation, and made it easier to recover from anomalies. 

## Mastery of Agile Methodologies 
In addition to devising and implement the technical solution for this team, Sam instituted various Agile techniques to help manage team execution and priorities effectively and efficiently. He established the teams charter, backlog, and roadmap. By enforcing these Agile ceremonies, the team was able to successfully deliver on Objectives and Key Results on a consistent bases, as well as effectively manage unplanned work. These duties are usually held by the Product Manager – but again, Sam rose to the occasion and did what was necessary for success. 

## Leadership Abilities 
Sam eventually grew into the team Anchor, a roll reserved for the most senior engineer on the team with the greatest domain context. He mentored, trained, and onboarded all new team members. He was the voice for cross functional collaboration, identifying and accounting for dependencies across the enterprise infrastructure to ensure their performance was unblocked. He became the chief technical advisor to the Government in this area. His Government counterpart refused to attend any technical interchanges or working groups without Sam. His opinion is incredibly valued, and most decisions are not finalized without his consideration. 

## Trusted Advisor to his team 
Over this period, Sam took on a new technical challenge, embraced expanded Product Manager responsibilities, thrived as team Anchor, and earned the trust to become the Government’s primary technical advisor – all in a software disciple he had no prior exposure to. Sam is an invaluable member of the SPA family, a model for engineering at SPA, and a trusted consultant to our Government customer.
